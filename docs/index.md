## Welcome to PTE-XDF

This site contains the documentation for the
`pte-xdf` project.

PTE-XDF provides an interface to load and work with XDF files in [MNE](https://mne.tools/).

Currently, it is only tested with files that were recorded with TMSi amplifiers.

## Table of contents

The documentation consists of four separate parts:

1. [Installation](installation.md)
2. [Quickstart Guide](quickstart-guide.md)
3. [API Reference](api-reference.md)
4. [How To Contribute](contribute.md)

Quickly find what you're looking for depending on
your use case by looking at the different pages.
